# ðŸ§© Lab Auth Joins
This project demonstrates the use of **MySQL JOINs** with a Node.js + Express backend. It includes user authentication and reporting endpoints.

# ðŸ“Œ JOINs Implemented
- **INNER JOIN** â€“ Returns users who have at least one role.
- **LEFT JOIN** â€“ Returns all users, along with their profile info if available.
- **RIGHT JOIN** â€“ Returns all roles, including those not assigned to any user.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN (emulated)** â€“ Combines users and profiles, showing all even if missing on either side.
- **CROSS JOIN** â€“ Returns every possible combination of users and roles.
- **SELF JOIN** â€“ Shows user referrals (who referred whom).
- **LEFT JOIN + Subquery** â€“ Returns the latest login per user.
